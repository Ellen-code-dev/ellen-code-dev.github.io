I am passionate about exploring the hybrid field of **Data Science, AI, and Machine Learning** while actively securing digital systems through **Ethical Hacking** and **Pentesting**.  

As a **Math and Computer Science enthusiast**, I am continuously learning and upskilling to extract actionable insights from data while protecting the information that powers these insights.  

This journey allows me to bridge the gap between **intelligent analytics** and **digital resilience**, combining analytical thinking with cybersecurity skills to create secure, data-driven solutions.  

I aim to contribute to projects that integrate AI, ML, and cybersecurity practices, ensuring that innovation and security go hand in hand.
